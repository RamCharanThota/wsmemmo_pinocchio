# wsmemmo_pinocchio
Memmo Winter-school material for the Pinocchio class

You can find a virtual box for this package in http://homepages.laas.fr/nmansard/u1604memmo.ova

The tutos run with jupyter

pip install jupyter --user
jupyter notebook

This will open a browser with a list of files and dirs. Browse to the repo and open the first notebook "1. Optimize ....ipynb"
Don't forget to start gepetto-viewer first: gepetto-gui
 
The talos data are in the APT robotpkg-talos-data . You need to have ROS kinetic for that http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu#Installation.2BAC8-Ubuntu.2BAC8-Sources.Setup_your_sources.list

Everything is already set up on the VBox.
